        <p class=" font-semibold text-3xl">1. Discuss the scope of var, let, and const.</p>
        <p class="text-2xl font-medium">var and let create variables that can be reassigned another value.
            const creates "constant" variables that cannot be reassigned another value.
            developers shouldn't use var anymore. They should use let or const instead.
            if you're not going to change the value of a variable, it is good practice to use const.</p>

        <p class=" font-semibold text-3xl">2. Tell us the use cases of null and undefined</p>
        <p class="text-2xl font-medium">Undefined means the variable has been declared, but its value has not been assigned. Null means an empty value or a blank value. The typeof() operator returns undefined for an undefined variable. The typeof() operator returns the type as an object for a variable whose value is assigned as null.</p>

        <p class=" font-semibold text-3xl">3. What do you mean by REST API?</p>
        <p class="text-2xl font-medium">RESTful API is an interface that two computer systems use to exchange information securely over the internet. Most business applications have to communicate with other internal and third-party applications to perform various tasks. For example, to generate monthly payslips, your internal accounts system has to share data with your customer's banking system to automate invoicing and communicate with an internal timesheet application. RESTful APIs support this information exchange because they follow secure, reliable, and efficient software communication standards.</p>
